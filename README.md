# Input Prioritization for Neural Networks


# Abstract
Input prioritization is a technique that can be
used to improve the efficiency of testing DNNs. It ranks
the test inputs based on their importance or relevance to
the task at hand and uses this ranking to prioritize which
inputs should be tested first. In this way, it can help to find
error-revealing test cases more quickly and with fewer test
input requirements. Thus, it can reduce the cost and time
required for labeling the test inputs. In this paper, several
different input prioritization methods for DNN testing are
evaluated. These methods include softmax-based standard
deviation and Euclidean distance methods, and top-k
neuron-coverage-based methods. The performance of these
methods are evaluated in experiments.
